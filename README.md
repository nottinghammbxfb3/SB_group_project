Generating structural and functional predictions for candidate genes generated by a selection scan.

## Introduction
The aims of this workflow:
- To create a consensus sequence of most common alleles at each nucleotide from tetraploid and diploid samples for candidate genes.
- Generate mutated protein sequences.
- Identify position and substitution of mutations.
- Generate structure prediction models for mutated and reference proteins.
- Make functional predictions of mutations in different ssamples.
