# Franklin Brown Github repository
Generating structural and functional predictions for candidate genes generated by a selection scan.

# Introduction
## The aims of this workflow:
- To create a consensus sequence of most common alleles at each nucleotide from tetraploid and diploid samples for candidate genes.
- Generate mutated protein sequences.
- Identify position and substitution of mutations.
- Generate structure prediction models for mutated and reference proteins.
- Make functional predictions of mutations in different samples.

# Data
- Reference genome:
  - C_excelsa_V5.fasta
- Reference annotation:
  - C_excelsa_V5_braker2_wRseq.gff3
- Variant call files:
  - UK_scan_dips.vcf (diploids)
  - UK_scan_tets.vcf (tetraploids)
- Gene names:
  - g30996 (chromosome 3)

# Code
## To create consensus proteins:
- Using VCF_consensus.py:
```diff
  - chromosome_number  Chromosome number
  - gene_name          Gene name (Same format as in GFF file)
  - gff_path           Path to GFF file
  - vcf_path           Path to VCF file
  - reference_path     Path to reference FASTA file
  - snp_finder_output  Output file for SNP finder (.csv)
  - consensus_output   Output file for consensus sequence (.txt)
  - dna_to_aa_output   Output file for DNA to AA translation (.txt)
```
- Example usage:
```diff
python VCF_consensus.py 6 g50328 gff_file.gff3 vcf_file.vcf reference_genome.fasta snps_out.csv consensus_out.txt translation_out.txt
 ```
## VCF_consensus.py function explanation: (For detail on code used please view VCF_consensus.py)
### SNP finder:
  - Reads VCF file into pandas dataframe
  - Selects specified chromosome rows
  - Reads GFF file in to pandas dataframe
  - Selects specified chromsome, gene name and coding regions
  - Selects VCF rows corresponding to coding regions identified in GFF file
  - Create seperate VCF subsets of multiallelic and biallelic sites
  - Create alternative allele frequency column for both subsets
  - For biallelic subset, select rows above 0.5 frequency (most frequent)
  - For multiallelic subset, create reference allele frequency column:
    - Identify most frequent alternative allele
    - Remove rows where reference is more frequent than most frequent alternative allele
    - Checking throughout there are any alternative alleles remaining to avoid downstream error
  - Merge biallelic and multiallelic subsets and output as .csv for consensus function

  - Example output:

    | #CHROM | POS | REF | ALT |
    |--------|-----|-----|-----|
    | Cexcelsa_scaf_6 | 3691953 | T | G |
    | Cexcelsa_scaf_6 | 3692547 | A | C |
    | Cexcelsa_scaf_6 | 3693361 | A | C |
### Consensus
  - Read in reference fasta file for specified chromsome sequence as a string
  - Using snps output .csv file replace single nucleotide polymorphisms in reference chromosome
  - Using GFF file, as in "SNP finder" extract coding regions from chromosome
  - Output consensus sequence as a string, consisting of mutated coding regions, as .txt file
  - Example output:
```diff
    TCATGTAACAATGGAATCACCTGCTGAGCTGGTTTCGCCTTCGAGCCCAAAAA...
```
### DNA to amino acid
  - Read in consensus output file
  - Translate first 3 reading frames using codon to amino acid translation dictionary
  - Create reverse complement of DNA sequence
  - Translate final 3 reading frames using codon to amino acid translation dictionary
  - Output to .txt file with each reading frame translation on newline
  - Example output:
```diff
  SCNNGITC_AGFAFFERAQKIGKFLRDGLICLC__I...AHRV
  HVTMESPAELVSPSSKEPKKLASF_ETV_FVFVNKS...TTAL
  M_QWNHLLSWFRLLRKSPKNWQVSERRFDLSLLINL...ARSS

  _RAPSYRSRTGSNTTYSSASLETRATASRRSSIKHS...PLLH
  DERRRIEAAQAQIRRIHQLHWRHAPRLHGEAL_STR...HCYM
```
  - Infer correct reading frame following criteria (shown in green):
    - Start with start codon (M)
    - End with stop codoon (_)
    - Likely, fewest mismatches in multiple sequence alignment with reference
